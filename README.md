touch-win src/bin/cli.js src/helpers/file.js src/helpers/directory.js

# Return
successfully created "src\bin\cli.js"
successfully created "src\helpers\files.js"
successfully created "src\helpers\directory.js"
```

```bash
# Use with option "base"
touch-win --base src/components/new_component component.js style.sass

# return
successfully created "src\components\new_component\style.sass"
successfully created "src\components\new_component\component.js"
```

```bash
# Use with option "template"
touch-win --template src/components/NewComponent.[rf] js test.js css

# return
successfully created "src\components\NewComponent.js"
successfully created "src\components\NewComponent.test.js"
successfully created "src\components\NewComponent.css"
```

```bash
# Use with option "template"
